%%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist follows the references.  Please
% read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these
% questions.  For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
% \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.  You are strongly encouraged to include a {\bf
% justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
% your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~\ref{gen_inst}.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
% \end{itemize}
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
% limit.  In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the
% Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item For all authors...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
    \answerYes{}
  \item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
    \answerYes{Yes, in Section \ref{sec:generation}.}
  \item Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?
    \answerNo{The method we propose is a general machine learning method. It comes with all the risks involved, but in our opinion does not pose any particular risk.}
  \item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
    \answerYes{}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are including theoretical results...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
	\item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you ran experiments (e.g. for benchmarks)...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
    \answerYes{In the corresponding github.}
  \item Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)?
    \answerYes{Yes, in section \ref{app:zoo_generation} and in the published code.}
	\item Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?
    \answerYes{We report mean and standard deviation for all results.}
	\item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
    \answerYes{Details on the dataset generation are reported in Appendix \ref{app:zoo_generation}}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators?
    \answerYes{I.e., the image datasets}
  \item Did you mention the license of the assets?
    \answerNo{The image datasets we use are common machine learning datasets,  which is why we refrain from mentioning their license.}
  \item Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL?
    \answerYes{The main contribution is the dataset, which we make available online.}
  \item Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you're using/curating?
    \answerNA{No personal data was used for this work.}
  \item Did you discuss whether the data you are using/curating contains personally identifiable information or offensive content?
    \answerNA{The datasets contain no personal information. As we use common machine learning datasets they also do not contain offensive content.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable?
    \answerNA{Our experiments do not rely on crowdsourcing nor did we conduct research on human subjects.}
  \item Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?
    \answerNA{Our experiments do not rely on crowdsourcing nor did we conduct research on human subjects}
  \item Did you include the estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation?
    \answerNA{Our experiments do not rely on crowdsourcing nor did we conduct research on human subjects}
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
